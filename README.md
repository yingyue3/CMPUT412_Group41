# Exercise 1
The code for this exercise is in the file Exercise 1. 

We created it based on the Duckietown manule (https://docs-old.duckietown.org/daffy/duckietown-robotics-development/out/basic_development.html)

# Exercise 2
In this exercise, we worked with ROS nodes and topics to control the Duckiebotâ€™s movement and process sensor data. We began by subscribing to the camera topic, then implemented basic motion tasks such as moving in a straight line and rotating in place. Finally, we tackled a D-shaped trajectory, which required precise calibration. Throughout the exercise, we used ROSBag to record and analyze data, faced calibration challenges, and resolved issues like endless wheel spinning using rospy.on_shutdown().
